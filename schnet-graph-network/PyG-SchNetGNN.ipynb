Another way to understand this is that each mini-batch is one large graph comprised of multiple disconnected sub-graphs.  The PyG dataloader will generate a `batch` vector that assigns each feature in the mini-batch into a distinct subgraph.  This is useful for message passing networks (such as SchNet) and pooling layers to produce a distinct regression prediction for each molecule.
